You can see it _in action_ at https://clvlabs.github.io/batukeitor-demo/.

## Easy setup
Clone this repo or download the `zip` file and unpack it into any web-hosted folder and... _voil√†_!

After that, you will have to customize your crew info and create some scores. The [Demo crew README](https://github.com/clvLabs/batukeitor-crew-demo/tree/master/README.md) will give you some more information on the matter.
